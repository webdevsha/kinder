family-first adaptive reading platform for Malaysia. It takes any digital text—from complex news articles (Berita Harian) to public reports—and transforms it into a "living" educational experience.Built on Cetalabs' "frugal tech" model, Pelita uses a chain of small, specialized, and controllable AI models (SLMs) to ensure all content is safe, culturally aligned, and educationally rich. It is designed from the ground up to serve the KSSM/KSSR curriculum and promote family-community wellness.Core Features of the Pelita Web App1. The "Remix" Reader (Your Language & Level Feature)This is the main interface, similar to the Newsela screenshots. A user sees an article on the left and the "Activities" sidebar on the right.Key Toggles:Bahasa (Language): Instantly translate and adapt the text between:Bahasa Melayu (Standard)EnglishTamilMandarin(Future: Iban, Kadazan-Dusun)Aras (Level): Adapt the reading level with one click.Aras 1 (Kanak-kanak): Simple sentences, storytelling style, key terms defined.Aras 2 (Remaja - KSSM): Clear, formal, aligned with secondary school vocabulary.Aras 3 (Dewasa/Asal): The original, complex text.The "Wellness" Algorithm (Your Diverse AI Safety):This is Pelita's "secret weapon." Before any text is shown, it passes through your "Penapis Jati Diri" (Community Guardrail). This is a custom-prompted SLM that:Filters Toxicity: Removes harmful language and hate speech.Applies Wellness Principles: Rewrites graphic or distressing content into a factual, "family-safe" narrative. (e.g., explains what happened in a conflict without the traumatic details, aligning with your Al-Ghazali-inspired framework).Aligns with Local Values: Ensures examples and explanations are culturally appropriate (using Malaysian names, local scenarios, and aligning with Rukun Negara principles).2. The "Rentas" Sidebar (Your Cross-Subject & Bloom's Features)This is the "smarter sidebar" you described, which makes Pelita more than a reader—it's a connector.Feature A: "Rentas Subjek" (Cross-Subject Notes)How it works: As a student reads an article in Bahasa Melayu about a recent flood ("Banjir di Selangor")...The sidebar automatically populates with connected concepts from their other subjects, pulling directly from KSSM/KSSR source material.Tab Sains (KSSM F4): "Siklus Hidrologi: Mengapa Banjir Berlaku?" (The Hydrologic Cycle: Why Floods Happen) - with references to the textbook.Tab Geografi (KSSM F2): "Kesan Pemanasan Global di Asia Tenggara." (Effects of Global Warming in SEA) - with references.Tab Sejarah (KSSM F5): "Peristiwa Banjir Besar Kuala Lumpur 1971." (The 1971 KL Floods).Why it's Frugal (The Tech): This isn't AGI. This is a fast, cheap RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system. We pre-load (index) all KSSM/KSSR digital textbooks. A simple, fast SLM finds matching keywords (banjir) and retrieves the correct, human-written notes. It's safe, fast, and 100% accurate to the curriculum.Feature B: "Aktiviti Bloom" (Deeper Bloom's Activities)How it works: Pelita generates a set of activities for teachers and parents that go far beyond a simple quiz, covering the entire Bloom's Taxonomy.(1) Remembering: [Quiz] "Who was involved? What happened?" (Like Newsela's).(2) Understanding: [Write Prompt] "Explain in your own words why the flood occurred." (Like Newlsela's).(3) Applying - Deeper): [Scenario] "Your family is given a 2-day flood warning. What are the 5 most important items you pack? Why?"(4) Analyzing - Deeper): [Debate] "What are the pros and cons of building concrete river walls vs. planting more trees?"(5) Evaluating - Deeper): [Judge] "Read the official report. Do you think the local government's response was effective? What grade (A-F) would you give them and why?"(6) Creating - Deeper): [Project] "Design a simple 'flood alert' system for your home using household items. Draw it and explain how it works."🛠️ The Frugal Tech Stack (To Build Your Prototype)This is not hard. You can build this prototype locally using a "chain of specialists," avoiding massive API costs.UI (The "Canvas"): StreamlitThis is your biggest shortcut. It's a Python library that lets you build a beautiful AI web app in minutes with no web development experience. Your "Remix" toggles and "Rentas" sidebar are just standard st.selectbox and st.tabs.AI Engine (The "Compute"): OllamaThis will run all your small, local models (SLMs) on your machine. It's the engine for your "frugal tech" philosophy.AI Logic (The "Algorithm"): LangChainThis is the Python "glue" that connects your Streamlit UI to Ollama. You will build a "prompt chain" that passes the article from one specialist model to the next (e.g., Article $\rightarrow$ Guardrail Model $\rightarrow$ Level 1 Model $\rightarrow$ Bloom's Model).The "Specialist" Models (All running in Ollama):The Extractor/RAG Model: nomic-embed-text. This is a tiny, fast model only for finding the KSSM notes.The "Guardrail" & "Leveler" Model: Phi-3-mini (4B) or Llama 3 8B. This model is smart enough to handle all your rewriting, leveling, and safety-prompting.The "Bloom's" Model: Llama 3 8B. This model is excellent at creative, "teacher-like" tasks such as generating your scenarios and project ideas.This entire stack is free, open-source, and runs on your laptop. You can build the entire core product of Pelita this way, proving its value before you need to scale.
